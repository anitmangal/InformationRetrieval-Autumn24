As Orthodox Easter Sunday was held, thousands of homemade rockets were aimed at church towers in the Aegean island of Chios by rival parishioners in their traditional ‘mock war’.

The number of deaths every year in Britain – which have been falling for the past 40 years – will rise by 20 per cent over the next two decades, as the lives of unprecedented numbers born in the post-baby boom come to an end.

No one knew too much about him last season outside of Portugal and Slovenia so was it a gamble? You only have to look at his price tag to see how highly-rated he was. He cost €16million (£11.5m) and that is a La Liga record for a goalkeeper. No. He has recovered brilliantly and now the clamour is for him to start all matches. Simeone's number two Mono Burgos is a big fan. We deserved more reward from all the chances we had but we didn't get it because he played so well.' And it really was a very special first half. Has he fitted into the dressing room? He speaks some English, some Portuguese, and some Spanish so he can make himself understood without problems. Other strengths? How good can he become?

The following Monday, police said, the girl found 'gifts and several letters, some encrypted, in her locker and desk,' according to the criminal complaint.

The cost of paying for rising numbers of deaths as the unprecedented numbers of post-World War Two babies come to the end of their lives may be too much for many families, a report said. It predicted that numbers of deaths in Britain, which have been falling for 40 years, will start to go up and increase by 20 per cent over the next two decades. Younger people are finding it increasingly difficult to afford homes or to start families, and in the long-term their pensions are much less secure than those of their parents, many of whom enjoyed the generous and fast-disappearing defined benefit pension system. ‘We all need to talk more about dying and ensure we are prepared for the inevitable.

The Ivorian's CV tells the story of a player who has always placed pragmatism above sentiment when it comes to his choice of clubs. Toure, for example, left home as a teenager to play in the Belgian second division. Following that came some formative years playing for Metalurh Donetsk in eastern Ukraine. It looks extremely likely that he will leave England this summer. If and when he does go, though, it is for his extraordinary contribution on the field – and not the unfortunate noise that has started to surround him - for which he should be remembered. Back in 2010, he arrived as a statement signing - a £24m fee and £1m a month – for a club determined to accelerate its own learning curve. Not over the first few yards but when he gets going he is unstoppable. The plan was straight forward. 'I love Mario,' he said. They will miss him when he goes.

City, whose current squad cost a total of £368million, host West Ham on Sunday but a Champions League spot next year is still in doubt with just four points separating them and fifth place Liverpool with six games to play. Eriksson, who was the last manager at City before the club was taken over by Abu Dhabi billionaire Sheikh Mansour and his family, said they have underperformed given their financial clout.

The FA announced this week that England are pulling out of the event with immediate effect in order to achieve a more varied fixture list, including more foreign opposition.

I understand why people are skeptical of self-defense claims -- especially from law enforcement. If not for the video taken by a bystander, I can't help but think that this story would be shuttered behind the wall of an active investigation. Thank God there was a camera. It will help ensure that justice will be served in this case. Of course not. Most importantly, we have to ask ourselves this: What's the value of a human life? Certainly it's worth the price of some mass data storage. And there's something else at stake. As tension rises, the risk of more shootings increases.

With Old Firm bosses Ronny Deila and Stuart McCall looking on, it was the former who left happiest after seeing Tommy McIntyre’s side record a deserved victory. And as only local schoolkids and their parents were allowed in following trouble among fans at the last three finals, the match passed without any major off-field problems.

Atletico Madrid supporters have stopped fretting about departures because they have good reason to be confident in the people that run the club and their ability to find adequate replacements. In goal Sergio Asenjo became David De Gea, became Thibaut Courtois, who looks to have become Jan Oblak. Playmaker Diego Ribas became Arda Turan. The secret of their success is often exactly that – a secret. Transfers like Radamel Falcao were always shrouded in mystery.

His words hit a sore spot for her and she felt compelled to share her sexual health status. ‘Yeah, that’s really funny.

The former Manchester United defender has been critical of Pellegrini's side in recent weeks as the reigning Premier League champions have seen their chances of retaining the crown slip following a dismal run of form and results. But, despite the Chilean being the favourite with many bookmakers to be the next managerial casualty and Jurgen Klopp available in the summer after announcing he is to leave Borussia Dortmund, it is understood City chiefs are not entertaining the idea of replacing Pellegrini at present.
